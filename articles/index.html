                    Often, we tend to think that writing is about communicating our ideas with others. There is definitely
                    truth to that, but I think that this isn't the whole story. Writing can be about communicating with <em>ourselves</em>
                    just as much as with others. There is something about personally taking the time to shape ideas into the form
                    of words that helps us internalize and consider them more deeply.

                    That is the primary purpose of this page. I write these articles to improve my own understanding of what I
                    am working on, and I am happy to share my ideas in the chance that they might be useful to someone else. I do
                    not expect others to completely agree with anything I say—on the contrary, I would challenge everyone to deeply
                    consider their own opinions.
