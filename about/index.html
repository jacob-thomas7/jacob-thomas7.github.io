                <h1>About</h1>
                My name is Jacob Thomas, and I am a Computer Science Student attending Boise State University.

                <h2>Computer Science</h2>
                I've always wanted to be a programmer, even as early as elementary school. I was inspired by the engineering behind video games, particularily
                retro games, and wanted to create my own games. As I grew and learned to program, I found a love for the craft itself; the problem solving, the
                community, and the satisfaction of a finished program were all things I wanted to be involved in.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                Alongside my career focus in computer science, I am also an avid musician! My primary musical experience is in drumline, mallet percussion,
                and piano. I am also practicing the organ and other percussion instruments. I currently play snare drum for the Boise State Blue Thunder Marching
                Band. I also enjoy composing music; I have published <a href="https://www.jwpepper.com/myscore/jacob-thomas">several pieces</a>. Finally, I
                teach younger percussionsts to help them develop their own skills.
