# Balance in All Things
---

Many have heard the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Goldilocks, a naive little girl,
stumbled upon the abode of the Three Bears. She sampled each of their bowls of porridge, finding
that one was too hot, one was too cold, and one was "just right!" She sat in each of their chairs,
again finding that while the first two were too hard or too soft, the third was "just right!"
Finally, she climbs into the third bed, as it was the only one that fit "just right!"

Goldilocks gets caught by the Three Bears, and after apologizing, the Bears forgive her and
they all become friends. Or, alternatively, she is so scared that she jumps out the window and
breaks her neck. Fairy tales are often much darker originally than what children are told these
days!

There are a variety of potential morals to be learned from this story, but I think there is one
that is quite often overlooked. That is the fact that Goldilocks, despite her questionable moral
decisions, determined that she didn't like the items that had too little of a certain quality,
but also that she didn't like those with too much of it. She had discovered what I believe to be
a near-universal law to the way the world works: that there is a **balance to all things**.

In my youth, my father explained to me the importance of balance to my well-being. Over time, I
have seen countless examples of things throughout life that have proved this point again and again.

## Types of Balance

### Quantifiable

Any subject of which there can be "too little", "too much", or "just right" the amount of, as Goldilocks
discovered in our earlier example, can be classified as *quantifiable*. Some examples include:

* **Eating Habits:** It's very important to our health to consume enough nutrients and calories to
keep it functioning. At the same time, eating too much food or too much of the same nutrient can be
unhealthy as well. A lack of iron in our diets can lead to weakness and fatigue, but consuming the
nearest steel ingot is also not a great idea. *There is a balance* to be found in our diets.

* **Conversation:** At least in my mind, the ideal flow of conversation is a natural, roughly even split
of speaking between each person involved. Most people don't enjoy it when one person takes control,
interrupting and talking over others, but it can also be awkward when they don't reply at all. *There
is a balance* to be found in contributing to a conversation.*

### Grouped
A group of subjects to balance which are in some way opposing or exclusive to each other is *grouped*.
The defining factor of this balancing problem is that several quantifiable balancing subjects share a
resource.

* **Time Management:** The classic, still unperfected example of a group is time management. The amount
of time spent on one activity has a balance by itself, but there are any number of activities just like
this which must share a limited amount of time.

## Balance and Physics

Physics itself seems to have a clear connection to balance. Even in grade school, I was introduced to the idea
of *equilibrium*, in particular relating to energy's tendency towards it. Heat tends to spread out, becoming
less concentrated. When someone touches an object with more energy, or hotter, than their hand, the heat begins to
move into their hand. Conversely, when touching a cooler object, heat leaves their hand to move into the object.
This is a clear example of the second law of thermodynamics itself seeking for balance.


However, it doesn't stop there. A fantastic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxL2HoqLbyA) by
Veritasium explains the concept of entropy, and even argues that *the reason life exists at all* is because
of the universe currently having *moderate entropy*. States of either high or low entropy essentially have
nothing happening at all, but the intermediate entropy we have allows for more complexity—namely, life.

## Going Forward

With all this in mind, it can be difficult to comprehend how exactly to manage and balance everything.
I think the answer to this question is quite simple and somewhat ironic: we must balance how much we think
about balancing our lives!


The goal of this is simply to become more aware of how balance plays a key role in our lives, and to hopefully
become a little better each day, week, and month, so that over time it has a significant positive impact on our
well-being. That said, a puzzle of this magnitude, especially when the subject is as unpredictable as human life,
can easily drive anyone crazy! I believe the healthiest (most balanced) way to consider this information is to
apply it over time, but not worry too much about every single detail of our lives being perfectly balanced right
away.
